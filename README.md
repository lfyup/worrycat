Updated: May , 2023

Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Thanks for using service provided by WorryCat. Please be sure to carefully read and fully understand the following policy. When using the service provided by WorryCat, you agree to have read and accepted all privacy policy; otherwise, please do not use the product.

We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we receive from users of our application for mobile devices and tablet computers (the “Apps”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the App and site.

**How do we collect and use information?**

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Apps, Site and related services (collectively, the “Services”). WorryCat may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. This service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this service.

**Account Information**

Except as described below, we do not collect any information that can be used to contact or identify you directly, such as your full name, email address, postal address or phone number (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”) in connection with your use of the services.

**Information Related to Use of the Services**

Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a Userʼs Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, operating system, the links and advertisements on our services that a User clicked on, the amount of time you interact with the services and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Usersʼ needs and preferences. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our services are used.

**Mobile Device Information**

When you access the services via a mobile device, we will collect information related to the mobile device such as the serial number or MAC address and the open UDID of the device. We may use this information to improve and personalize our services for you.

**Advertising & Third Party Products and Services**

The services are supported via advertising, and we collect certain data to help the services serve ads. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the services, including the unique identification ID of your mobile device. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties canʼt identify you personally.

**Links to Other Sites**

Our services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and weʼre not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.

**Children Protect**

Our Policy Toward Children

Our Services are for children over 4+ .

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, weʼll notify you of such changes by posting them on the services or by sending you a notification and weʼll indicate when such changes will become effective.
